Amazon elastic block storage provides persistenet block storage volume for use with amazon EC2 instanc in the AWS cloud.
                                It has five types
                                           1.general purpose SSD
                                           2. provisional IOPS
                                           3.through put optimaized HDD
                                           4.cold HDD
                                           5. magnetic.
                                                                               ENI  ( Elastic network interface)

It is used for basic networking,perhaps u need a separate management network to ur production network (or) separate logging 
logging network and u need to do this low cost.I n this scinerio u ans use multipul number of ENI for each network.

                                                                             EN  (Enhanced networking) 

When u speed the internet from 10 gbps to 100 gpbs u can use this for better enhancing.

When u need to accelerate HPC (high performence computing) and machine learning applications (or) u need to do on OS by- pass.
